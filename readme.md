The final course project for SDS front end.

The page can be either run, but cloning the repository onto your local machine and opening the index.html in public folder, or by going to https://roniseppala.github.io/Software-development-skills-final-project/index.html


Note: the javascript is in the html files indstead of the .js file, as when accessing the page from github pages, the javascript did not open correctly every time, thus resulting in the menu button not working.
If this occures still, you can fix the button usually by refreching the page with ctrl+f5
