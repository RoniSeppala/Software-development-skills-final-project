                    <h3>BIO</h3>
                    <p>J. Robert Oppenheimer (born April 22, 1904, passed February 18, 1967) was an American theoretical physicist and director of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II. He is often called the "father of the atomic bomb" - Wikipedia</p>

                    <h3>Professor at Berkeley</h3>
                    <p> At Berkeley, where he prospered as an advisor and collaborator to a generation of physicists who admired him for his intellectual virtuosity and broad interests. His students and colleagues saw him as mesmerizing: hypnotic in private interaction, but often frigid in more public settings. His associates fell into two camps: one saw him as an aloof and impressive genius and aesthete, the other as a pretentious and insecure poseur. -wikipedia</p>

                    <h3>Atomic Energy Commission board of consultants member</h3>
                    <h6>1947-1952</h6>
                    <p>As a member of the Board of Consultants to a committee appointed by Truman, Oppenheimer strongly influenced the 1946 Achesonâ€“Lilienthal Report. In this report, the committee advocated the creation of an international Atomic Development Authority, which would own all fissionable material and the means of its production, such as mines and laboratories, and atomic power plants where it could be used for peaceful energy production. -wikipedia</p>

                    <h3>Enrico Fermi Avard</h3>
                    <h6>1959</h6>
                    <p>In March 1963, the General Advisory committee of the AEC selected Oppenheimer to receive its Enrico Fermi Award, an award Congress had created in 1954. Kennedy was assassinated before he could present the award to Oppenheimer, but his successor, Lyndon Johnson, did so in a December 1963 ceremony at which he cited Oppenheimer's "contributions to theoretical physics as a teacher and originator of ideas, [and] leadership of the Los Alamos Laboratory and the atomic energy program during critical years" -Wikipedia</p>
